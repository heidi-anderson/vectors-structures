# vectors-structures
This is the fifth homework in CSC 215

This program reads data from a CSV file. There is one record per line that is stored in a structure and then added to a vector. The first element is an employee ID, the second is the first name, the third is the last name, the fourth is the salary and the fifth is the bonus. The program sorts the vector in one of three ways, by name, salary, or ID. After the vector has been sorted the data is output to a CSV file in the same order with the same headers and the data in the same order.
